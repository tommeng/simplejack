---WIP---</br></br>
A simple network layer for android applications.
To help get a project up and running very quickly. (Maybe to help with some coding interviews)

Right now it supports:
GET, POST, JSON responses

Uses [OKHTTP http client](https://github.com/square/okhttp) and [GSON json parser](https://github.com/google/gson).
